# GEE-Coordinates2PNG
**WORK IN PROGRESS**
This is a script written by me, where by using the google earth engine API and submitting some coordinates, a PNG of those coordinates will be returned.


Current Snag List:
1. Need to determine when file finished uploading
2. Need to determine how to get file from Google Drive (GDOWN)
3. Need to convert GeoTiff file to PNG
4. Need to fix output GEOTIFF file, currently faulty
