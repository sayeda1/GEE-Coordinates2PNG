# GEE-Coordinates2PNG
**WORK IN PROGRESS**
This is a script written by me, where by using the google earth engine API and submitting some coordinates, a PNG of those coordinates will be returned.


Current Snag List:
1. Need to determine when file finished uploading. **Resolved**
2. Need to determine how to get file from Google Drive (GDOWN). **Resolved**
3. Need to convert GeoTiff file to PNG. **Resolved**
4. Need to fix output GEOTIFF file, currently faulty. **Resolved**
